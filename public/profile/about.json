    "about": "Hey! I’m *Rustam*, but most folks know me as *Bro*. I’m a junior front-end dev, slowly leveling up to full-stack. I love whipping up sleek, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces with React, JS, and modern CSS vibes like Tailwind, MUI, Bootstrap.\n\nWhat really gets me hyped about web dev? That mix of creativity and logic — making things look good, feel smooth, and actually work.\n\nI usually code solo since I’m kinda introverted, and freelancing gives me that freedom. When I’m not glued to a screen, I’m into **CTF challenges**, speedcubing, or gaming — mostly shooters like *CS*, *PUBG*, or *SO2*. Oh, and music’s always on in the background. 🎵",
